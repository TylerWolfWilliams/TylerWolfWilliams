Hi, Iâ€™m @TylerWolfWilliams
I am a Data Analyst and Software Engineer who graduated from the University of St. Thomas in 2024.
I have B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Data Science and a passion for finding and working on fascinating problems.
Throughout my burgeoning career I have worked on a variety of projects that I'm hoping to compile here!
Take a look around and let me know what you like, don't like, or have questions about!
